# Startup Costs Calculator

## Overview

This repository contains a Startup Costs Calculator created using Excel. The calculator helps entrepreneurs and startups estimate the costs involved in starting a new business.

## Calculation Methodology

The Startup Costs Calculator uses the following methodology to estimate startup costs:


1. **Total Investments:** This includes all initial investments required to start the business, such as equipment purchases, building renovations, and other one-time expenses.

2. **Total Fixed Costs:** Fixed costs are recurring expenses that do not vary with the level of production or sales. This includes expenses like rent, insurance, salaries, and utilities.

3. **Total Monthly Costs:** This includes all recurring monthly expenses, both fixed and variable. Variable costs may include expenses like raw materials, shipping, and marketing.

4. **Total Cost (Fixed + Recurring):** The total cost is the sum of total fixed costs and total monthly costs. This gives a comprehensive view of the total expenses involved in running the business.

5. **Surplus/(Deficit):** This is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. A surplus indicates that the business is making more money than it is spending, while a deficit indicates the opposite.

The calculator allows users to input values for each category and automatically calculates the total cost, surplus, or deficit based on the inputs. This helps entrepreneurs plan their finances and understand the financial feasibility of their startup.
